You can find a brief essay on what exactly python is [here](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/). A lot of the words they talk about might not make sense to you, so I would either recommend looking them up or asking a TA/Professor.\n","\n","These are some characteristics that make python special:\n","- **Interpreted**: In a compiled language, the target machine directly translates the program. In an interpreted language, the source code is not directly translated by the target machine. Instead, a different program, aka the interpreter, reads and executes the code. [source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/compiled-versus-interpreted-languages/)\n","- **Object-oriented**: Object-oriented programming is about modeling a system as a collection of objects, where each object represents some particular aspect of the system. [source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_programming)\n","- **High-level**: A high-level language (HLL) is a programming language that enables a programmer to write programs that are more or less independent of a particular type of computer. [source](https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/high-level-language/)\n","- **Dynamically typed**: Dynamically-typed languages are those where the interpreter assigns variables a type at runtime based on the variable's value at the time. [source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Dynamic_typing)"],"metadata":{"id":"OrB4dTsOBW7L"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Why is python useful?\n","\n","Learning python will be useful to you no matter what you are studying in college. It can be used equally both in the data science field as well as others such as liberal arts, chemistry, biology, web development, engineering, political science etc. Python is basically the new excel, learning it will make your like much much easier as it can automate a lot of menial tasks."],"metadata":{"id":"dM-lcERXApvB"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Installing python locally\n","Installing python will vary depending on the operating system that you are currently using\n","\n","##### **MACOS**\n","If you are using a macbook, python2 comes preinstalled, by all means DO NOT use the preinstalled version! You can check if it is installed by typing `python --version` in the terminal. Instead follow the instructions [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/) to install **python3** on your local machine. You can also use **homebrew** to install python if that software is already installed on your laptop.\n","\n","##### **Windows**\n","You also might have **python2** preinstalled, please DO NOT use this even if it is already there. Instead follow the instructions [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) to install **python3** on your local machine. ~~You can also use the **Microsoft app store** to install python, this might honestly be the easier route.~~ **Update**: After reading up on using the app store to install python on windows, I came across this [article](https://dev.to/naruaika/why-i-didn-t-install-python-from-the-microsoft-store-5cbd) that described the headache the app store install causes. Therefore just save youself the hassle and follow the official python install linked above.\n","\n","##### **Linux**\n","If you're running Linux as your primary operating system, I'm going to assume you already know how to use python and you're taking this class as an easy A. But you can follow the directions [here](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/) if you need help. If you're using Ubuntu, all you need to do is `sudo apt-get install python3.8`"],"metadata":{"id":"pYI9BFFVBneD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Other Notebook Tools\n","\n","##### **Google Colab**\n","For those of you who would rather not face the hassle of downloading python and editing notebooks locally, you can use a tool called [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). This tool is hosted on google servers and anyone with a valid google account can use it! I often use this tool when I need to connect to a GPU.\n","\n","##### **Rutgers ILabs**\n","If you have an account on the rutgers ilabs already (you must be a CS major), you can work on notebooks using the school's compute. You can access jupyter hub using [here](https://jupyter.cs.rutgers.edu/), when asked for credentials make sure you input your CS department credentials\n","\n","##### **Jupyter Notebooks** (Recommended)\n","If you want to run jupyter notebooks locally, you can follow the directions listed [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), it recommends new users to use a package manager called Anaconda which I will explain more about in the next section."],"metadata":{"id":"7oaQDfexEPlJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Virtual Environments\n","The concept of a virtual environment is something that makes python special. The reson we have them is due to the vast amount of open source python packages that a programmer has access to (pandas, numpy etc.). \n","\n","During our project, it may require a third-party library, which we install. Another project also uses the same directory for retrieval and storage but doesn't require any other third-party packages. So, the virtual environment can come into play and make a separate isolated environment for both projects, and each project can store and retrieve packages from their specific environment. [source](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/engineering/python-virtual-environments/#why-do-we-need-a-virtual-environment)\n","\n","##### **Anaconda (Conda)** (Recommended)\n","Anaconda is a beginner friendly package management system that is widely used in industry. The Anaconda install comes with various GUIs that make it increadibly easy to track your virtual environments as well as packages that you have currently installed. Getting started with Anaconda is simple, just follow the instructions [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). **Update**: Since recitation, the professor has updated the files section with instructions on how to install and work with anaconda, navigate to `Files > Anaconda_setup.pdf`\n","\n","~~The reson I dislike Anaconda is that while it is easy to use and work with, the software comes with a lot of bloat. Things like spyder (the included IDE) is genuinely terrible and I'd rather not be forced to install that stuff if I can avoid it.~~\n","\n","##### **Venv (Virtual Environment)**\n","The python standard library actually comes with a built in solution for virtual environments called venv. Venv will be be the smoothest virtual environment manager to work with, however it has a learning curve and is not recommended for beginners. You can get started with it [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)\n","\n","##### **Pipenv**\n","Pipenv is my preferred virtual environment manager, however it is also not beginner friendly so use it at your own disgression. \n","\n","Pipenv is a packaging tool for Python that solves some common problems associated with the typical workflow using pip, virtualenv, and the good old requirements.txt. In addition to addressing some common issues, it consolidates and simplifies the development process to a single command line tool. [guide/source](https://realpython.com/pipenv-guide/)\n","\n","##### **No Virtual Environment/pip3** (Not Recommended)\n","Working with virtual environments is tricky, and though it might have a payoff in the long run, if you're planning on using python just for this class you most likely will not need to use a virtual environment. Instead, you can just use pip3 which comes with your python3 installation. However, if your packages get messed up, you will have to reinstall python which can be a pain. To install a package such as pandas, you can just type `pip3 install pandas`"],"metadata":{"id":"IbIQ7WNpIpRr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### The Python Package Index\n","\n","The python package index or [PYPI](https://pypi.org) is a repository of thousands of different packages which you can import and work with in your own python projects. If you have time, I would recommend clicking on the previously mentioned link and browsing through some of the packages availible to you."],"metadata":{"id":"0eUiTCf00dq7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\n","\n","An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, enables programmers to consolidate the different aspects of writing a computer program. IDEs increase programmer productivity by combining common activities of writing software into a single application: editing source code, building executables, and debugging. [source](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-an-ide)\n","\n","##### **PyCharm**\n","The most popular IDE used by python developers in industry is PyCharm. PyCharm is a development environment that allows you to edit, run, and deploy various python and ipynb (notebook) files with ease. It can also act as a package manager, depending on how you use it. You can refer to the standalone installation [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html#standalone).\n","\n","##### **Visual Studio Code (Recommended)**\n","Though it might not be as widely used, this newer text editor is growing rapidly in industry. VSCode is not just a python IDE, it is a new age text editor with easy access to extensions which enable it to become an IDE. You can also edit C, Java, Rust, Haskell, Perl, scala etc. languages using VSCode. Installation guide can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).\n","\n","##### **Other text editors**\n","If you don't want to bloat your laptop with large IDEs such as VSCode or PyCharm. You may opt to use a simpler text editor such as [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/download) or [Vim](https://opensource.com/article/19/3/getting-started-vim). When using these, remember that you must take the additional step of opening a terminal and running your code."],"metadata":{"id":"OM95LF2kPfQM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Final Notes\n","This class is meant to be a CS class for both CS students and non CS students alike. It is an intro course, which means that no prior knowledge is really necessary to take this course. If you feel that I am going to fast on important subjects, please get in touch with me and let me know your concerns. If you have any comments or concerns about what I have written here today, this notebook should be accessible to you via canvas `Files > Section 4 recitations > recitation_material.txt`. Please open the corresponding link, login with your Rutgers account and leave a comment. If I realize that I have missed something after recitation is completed, I will update the corresponding notebook accordingly.\n","\n","Lastly, please don't be discouraged if you feel like you are falling behind. Working with python/data science is something that even advanced programmers struggle with daily. If you need help please seek out a TA or Professor. I hope you have fun, and welcome to CS 210 :)"],"metadata":{"id":"Zlorm5nnXHRT"}}]}
